### Keras
---
Repo based on repo [Keras2Cpp](https://github.com/BrenoOR/keras2cpp)

This main code is set to compare your Keras MLP in Python with this MLP arch in C++.
It is build in QT, but check the [fork](https://github.com/BrenoOR/keras2cpp) to run without QT5.
Since we're using QT, do:
- 1. Create dir `/build`
- 2. Inside `/build` run `qmake ..`
- 3. Then `make`
